# Project Overview

This repository contains two distinct applications: a React-based login application and a Python-based Snake game.

## 1. React Login Application

This is a simple front-end application built with React, featuring a basic login form.

**Purpose:** To demonstrate a straightforward login interface.
**Credentials:** The application uses hardcoded credentials for demonstration purposes:
*   **Username:** `user`
*   **Password:** `password`

**Setup and Running:**
1.  Navigate to the React application directory (if it were in a subdirectory, otherwise assume root for setup).
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 2. Python Snake Game

A classic implementation of the Snake game using Python.

**Purpose:** To provide a fun, retro gaming experience.

**Running the Game:**
1.  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3.  Run the game script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```
